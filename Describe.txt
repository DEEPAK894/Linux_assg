3. Configure your system in such a way that when a user type and executes a describe command from anywhere of the system    
   it must list all the files and folders of the user's current directory. 
 Ans:-
       Step 1: Create a Shell Script.
             - Create a new file, describe.sh in the directory /usr/local/bin, and add the following lines to it:
      ```
         #!/bin/bash
            ls -a
      ```
             - This script simply runs the ls -a command, which lists all files and folders in the current directory, 
               including hidden files
        Step 2: Make the Script Executable:
               - Make the script executable using the following command:
                   ***chmod a+x describe.sh***
        Step 3: Test the Configuration by typing the describe in the terminal
