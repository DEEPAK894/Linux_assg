 6. Create a service with the name showtime , after starting the service, every minute it should print the current 
     time in a file in the user home directory.  
    Ex:-
       sudo service showtime start   -> It should start writing in file.
       sudo service showtime stop   -> It should stop writing in file.
       sudo service showtime status -> It should show status.
    Ans:-
          Step 1: Create the Shell Script that will write the current time to a file in the user's home directory.
                  - Name the script as showtime.sh and write below content into the file:
           ```
           #!/bin/bash
           FILE_PATH="/home/sigmoid/showtime_output.txt"
           while true; do
           echo $(date) >> "$FILE_PATH"
           sleep 60  
           done
           ```
           Step 2: Make the script executable
                  ***chmod +x showtime.sh*** 
           Step 3: Create a systemd service file named showtime.service in the ***/etc/systemd/system/*** directory 
                   and write the below code into that file.
           ```  
           [Unit]
           Description=Showtime Service
           After=network.target
           [Service]
           ExecStart=/home/sigmoid/showtime.sh
           Restart=always
           User=sigmoid
           Group=sigmoid
           [Install]
           WantedBy=multi-user.target
          ```
           -  The script will start searching for a compressed file named "research" with a specific extension 
           (e.g.,.gz or.zip) in our Linux filesystem. 
           -  If it finds the file, it will uncompress it accordingly and provide with the output.
           Step 4:  Reload Systemd:
                 After making changes to the service unit file, you need to reload the systemd manager configuration. 
                 Run the following command to reload systemd:
                       ***sudo systemctl daemon-reload***
           Step 5: Manage the Service:
                  - Command to start the service : ***sudo systemctl start showtime***
                  - Command to stop the service  : ***sudo systemctl stop showtime***
                  - Command to check the service status : ***sudo systemctl status showtime***
             * To check the output of the showtime.sh script, which continuously appends the current time to a file                     (showtime_output.txt).
             * If we want to continuously monitor the output file in real-time, you can use the tail command with 
               the -f (follow) option: ***tail -f ~/showtime_output.txt***
