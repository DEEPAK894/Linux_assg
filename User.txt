2.  Create a user in your localhost, which should not be able to execute the sudo command.
Ans:-
     - To create a new user, use the following command
           ***sudo useradd newuser*** 
     - By default, on most Unix-based systems, regular users are not in the sudo group, so they don't have sudo privileges.
