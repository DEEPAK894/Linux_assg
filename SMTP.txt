1.  Configure smtp in localhost.
Ans:-
Step 1: Install Postfix  on our Linux machine using the following command:
               ***sudo apt install postfix***
              
  Step 2: Configure Postfix.
        1. During the configuration, choose "Internet Site" and proceed.
        2. If needed, we can customize our mail settings.
        3. The main configuration file for Postfix is usually located at /etc/postfix/main.cf. 
        4. We can edit this file using a text editor like nano  
           
           ***sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf*** 
        5. In the file, modify the line  inet_interfaces = all to inet_interfaces = loopback-only 
        
  Step 3: Install mailutils.
           ***sudo apt install mailutils***  
  Step 4: Test the Configuration.
          We can now test our Postfix configuration by sending a test email using the following command.
             ***echo "This is the body of the email" | mail -s "Subject Line" email@mydomain.com***
