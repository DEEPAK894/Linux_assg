4. Users can put a compressed file at any path of the linux file system. The name of the file will be research
   and the extension will be of compression type, example for gzip type extension will be .gz.
   You have to find the file and check the compression type and uncompress it.<br>
Ans:-
     Step 1: Create a New Shell Script with file name as uncompress_research.sh using nano command and add the below 
             code into the file.
     ```
     #!/bin/bash
     compressed_file=$(find / -type f -name "research.*" 2>/dev/null)
     if [ -z "$compressed_file" ]; then
     echo "No compressed file named 'research' found."
     exit 1
     fi
     file_extension="${compressed_file##*.}"
     case "$file_extension" in
     "gz")
       uncompressed_file="${compressed_file%.gz}"
       gzip -d "$compressed_file"
       echo "File '$compressed_file' has been uncompressed using gzip."
        ;;
     "zip")
        uncompressed_file="${compressed_file%.zip}"
        unzip "$compressed_file" -d "$(dirname $compressed_file)"
        echo "File '$compressed_file' has been uncompressed using zip."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unsupported compression type: .$file_extension"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

 echo "Uncompressed file: $uncompressed_file"
 ```
    Step 2: Run the Script
             ***./uncompress_research.sh***
       - The script will start searching for a compressed file named "research" with a specific extension 
         (e.g., .gz or .zip) in our Linux filesystem. 
       - If it finds the file, it will uncompress it accordingly and provide you with the output.
